            <h5>SCORE</h5>
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                The happiness score is ranked from 0 – 10, 10 being the best possible life and 0 being the worst possible life. 
                There are six factors used –  economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, trust in government, 
                and generosity – that contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia.

            </p>
            <h5>DYSTOPIA</h5>
            <p>

                Dystopia is a hypothetical society that is extremely undesirable, with the world’s least happy people,
                whose countries values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the 
                six factors. This country acts as a benchmark against which all the other 
                countries can be favorably compared. The lowest score observed for the six measurements characterizes Dystopia.

            </p>
            <h5>RESIDUALS</h5>
            <p>
                The Dystopia residuals are used to reflect the distance of the six factors for each country from Dystopia. 
                The residuals are used to calculate the final happiness score so that the final evaluation will always be positive 
                even if the six factors all equal 0.

        <div class="row">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
            For this project the original data was downloaded as a csv file from Kaggle. It was then cleaned using Python, inside Jupyter 
            Notebook, and data wrangling techniques with relevant libraries such as Pandas. The data was then pushed to a 
            Postgres database using SQLAlchemy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The newly cleaned csv files were taken and converted into a SQLite database for this project. 
            SQLite proved as a more efficient connection as opposed to connecting directly to the Postgres database and 
            remapping the tables. A flask app was built connecting the database to our JavaScript and HTML code.

            <h5>HAPPINESS SCORE VS. SIX VARIABLES</h5>
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                Using <code>plotly.js</code>, a scatter plot was created. The plot helped illustrate how 
                much gravity each variable held when compared to the 
                happiness score.  Though each variable had a seemingly positive correlation, gdp, 
                family, and life expectancy had the largest impact on how happy an individual 
                felt throughout the three years. 
            </p>
            <br>
  
            <h5>AVG HAPPINESS SCORE BY REGION VS. POPULATION BY REGION</h5>
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                    In order to take a closer look at population and its relationship 
                    with the happiness score, a bar graph was made using <code>plotly.js</code>. 
                    When first examining the chart and only looking at the highest happiness score 
                    by region, lowest happiness score by region, and comparing that to its population, one can 
                    see that there seems to be an inverse effect. However, when examining the 
                    other happiness scores between the lowest and the highest, this conclusion 
                    quickly demonstrates its inaccuracy. There does not seem to be a discernable trend concerning 
                    these two variables. There is only a small amount of shift between both the 
                    average happiness score and the population. This is due to the limited amount of 
                    years being observed, ergo, we cannot make a confident statement about the 
                    negative correlation between the average happiness score and population size.

        <div class="row"><h2>DISCUSSION</h2></div>
        <div class="row">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                Our initial hypothesis was that there would be a meaningful and positive linear correlation 
                between the variables gdp, life expectancy, and trust in government and that these variables would be  
                the top three most impactful measurements for happiness score. Additioanlly, we believed that there would be a negative linear correlation between
                population size and happiness score. We were correct on two of the measurements, 
                however, our analysis illustrated that trust in government was the least impactful of all 
                the variables and that there was no distinguishable trend between happiness and population. There may be several explanations for this, 
                however, additional analysis would be needed. You can view each countries correlation coefficient between their happiness score and the six measured variables <a href= "/happinessCorr" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For a deeper examination of a countries happiness score, we would take a deeper dive into 
                each individual variable to try and answer questions like: <i class="font-italic">Why did these variables 
                have this specific effect on these countries? What do countries with different 
                democracies have in common? How does a country with a high GDP per Capita decide 
                to operate both locally and on a global scale? And how does that correlate with a countries happiness score?</i>
